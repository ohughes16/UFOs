# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Dana needed help making her UFO sightings website more interactive by utilizing more filters to analyze the data.js file even more. We needed to add filters for the city, state, country, and shape in addition to the date filter which we had already incorporated.

## Results



## Summary

For future development of this site, I would like to include the ability to add column filters on the table itself so you can explore the data before filtering on something as finite as a date. It could also be useful to add a more dynamic filter to allow for some kind of date range filtering. Our table dataset is limited to a small time window, if we were able to acquire a more robust dataset we could really utilize date filtering more.

Due to the website user generally being unfamiliar with the dataset and what kind of inputs they can type in, if we could provide users with drop down boxes or predefined selection criteria it could make filtering the data more efficient and useful. For example, there are only two country options in the table, "us" and "ca" for the US and Canada. If we made these selections rather than user input it would avoid user-error typos and allow the user to see what kind of filtering options they have.
